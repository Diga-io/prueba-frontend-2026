# Frontend Technical Test January 2026

[Leer este archivo en español aquí.](README.md)

## Installation

```bash
cd code
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Description

In this test, you will implement a design from Figma, the software you will be using alongside the design team at Diga.

The test consists of implementing a small dashboard that simulates the real functionality of our product: analyzing statistics and call details. You have one hour to complete it.

> [!note]
> **Duration of the exercise**
>
> Although you only have **one hour** to complete the exercise, it is designed to take longer. Do not worry if you are unable to finish. We want to evaluate your ability to prioritize and assess the importance of tasks.

## What does the task consist of?

You must implement this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/Nv7e6LVCWymsxPgsxRMa3v/Prueba-técnica---Frontend?node-id=1480-0&p=f&m=draw), using **React with TS** and **Tailwind CSS**.

You can start from this repository, which includes a default Vite installation pre-configured with TS and Tailwind installed. You can also find components from *Untitled*, the library we use at Diga.

This is the stack you will work with at the company; however, you can perform the test completely from scratch as long as you use **React 19**, **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**.

> [!WARNING]
> Our API does not return localhost in the CORS headers. In the provided Vite
> code, there is a pre-configured proxy to use the API directly
> ([learn more](#development-proxy)). If you use your own development server,
> you will need to configure your own proxy.

### Tasks to perform

These are the features you must implement. This list is simply a description of what you will find in the design.

These tasks are not in any specific order; organize them as you prefer.

- **Create a sidebar with two pages.**
    - The first one will be called "Subscription". You can find this component in [this file](./code/src/pages/subscription.tsx). That code works but has issues. **Refactor it** as you would in a real PR.
    - The second one will be "Call Register", showing the list of the first 20
    received calls.
    - The current page must be marked with a different style (check Figma).

- **Project Selector:** inside the sidebar, create a "Project Selector" that allows the user to change the API key used in requests. When the user switches projects, the page content must **reload automatically**.

- **State Handling:** Loading states and error states must be handled differently and explicitly.

#### Extras

If you wish, you can also implement the following features:

- **Loading Skeletons:** Implement a skeleton-mode loading animation (see design).
- **Empty States:** Implement a distinct state for when the listing endpoint returns nothing.
- **Unit Testing:** Add any unit tests you consider necessary.

## Useful Resources

Here are some resources that may be useful for the development of the test.

### API Documentation

The necessary endpoints are detailed below. For authentication, you must send the selected **API Key** in the headers.

`GET https://api.diga.io/v1/billing/subscription`

**Headers**

| Key | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <API_KEY_FROM_SELECTOR>` |

### Development Proxy

> [!WARNING]
> Our API does not return `localhost` in the CORS headers. If you use the
> provided Vite base code, there is a pre-configured proxy you can use.
> If you use your own development server, you will need to configure your
> own proxy.

The proxy is configured in `code/vite.config.ts` and redirects all requests
starting with `/api` to `https://api.diga.io`, removing the `/api` prefix
from the path.

**Usage example:**

```typescript
// In your code, instead of calling the API directly:
fetch("https://api.diga.io/v1/billing/subscription", { ... })

// Use the proxy with the /api prefix:
fetch("/api/v1/billing/subscription", { ... })
```

The proxy will handle:
- Redirecting the request to `https://api.diga.io/v1/billing/subscription`
- Adding the necessary CORS headers
- Keeping the connection secure (HTTPS)

### Library Documentation

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/)
- [Untitled UI Components](https://www.untitledui.com/react/components)

You may also use any external resource or tool you consider necessary (LLMs, Stack Overflow, etc.).

### API Keys

The project selector should be able to switch among these API keys:
- sk-944645d244ddfa2890b77f2c1262e595d1aa6ad89a8d3775cb29c036dba9d55d
- sk-f0d89d3b2924ea11f47db647e9090bec96e4c13db9b9094d9032c31910842a61
- sk-7ae237700e65605e400e32e42811130acf34a7aefbc8eb42c10107faba758e91

These are API keys for real Diga projects. They have mock subscriptions and calls
that you can use to work in this exercise.

---

## Other annotations

- Although we have an endpoint to get the name of the project, there's no need
to use it. You can display the first 10 characters of each API key in the selector.
- The selected API key can be stored in memory, don't bother saving it in
localStorage if you don't want.
- You can find some resources (such as our logo for the sidebar) in the public
directory.
- There are pre-created classes with the colors used in Figma, as well as
classes with pre-configured font sizes and typefaces.
- The libraries react-router-dom and @react-types/overlays are included as
dependencies.
- Untitled has some predefined utility functions that can help you in
[this directory](./code/src/utils). For example, `cx` for joining classes.
